## Self-Hosted (Recommended for most users)

Deploy Quackback on your own infrastructure with full control over your data.

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name quackback \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/quackback" \
  -e SECRET_KEY="your-secret-32-chars-minimum" \
  -e BASE_URL="https://your-domain.com" \
  ghcr.io/quackbackio/quackback:latest
```

### With Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quackbackio/quackback.git
cd quackback
cp .env.prod.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings (generate secrets with: openssl rand -base64 32)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

> The root `docker-compose.yml` is for **local development only** (datastores, no app service). Use `docker-compose.prod.yml` to self-host — it bundles the app plus Postgres and MinIO with hardened defaults.

See the [Self-Hosted Guide](./self-hosted/README.md) for complete documentation.

---

## Azure (Container Apps)

A cloud-native deployment where each concern is a managed service rather than a
process on a single VM: the web and background tiers are separate Container
Apps, migrations are a Container Apps Job, and Postgres and Blob Storage are
managed and private.

```bash
cd deploy/azure/terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # then edit
terraform init -backend-config=...             # see the guide
terraform apply
```

See the [Azure Guide](./azure/README.md) for the architecture, the Terraform, the
GitHub Actions workflows, and the deployment gotchas (no connection pooler in
front of the app, the worker's fixed minimum replica, `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`).

---

## Quackback Cloud (Internal)

The `cloud/` directory contains Cloudflare Workers deployment configuration for Quackback Cloud (app.quackback.io).

> **Note**: This is used internally by the Quackback team. Self-hosted users should ignore this directory.

See the [Cloud Deployment Guide](./cloud/README.md) for internal documentation.

## Build Variants

Quackback supports different build configurations:

| Command                           | Edition     | EE Features | Target     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| `bun run build`                   | Self-hosted | No          | Bun        |
| `bun run build:community`         | Self-hosted | No          | Bun        |
| `bun run build:enterprise`        | Self-hosted | Yes         | Bun        |
| `bun run build:cloud`             | Cloud       | Yes         | Cloudflare |
| `bun run deploy:cloud:dev`        | Cloud       | Yes         | Cloudflare |
| `bun run deploy:cloud:production` | Cloud       | Yes         | Cloudflare |

The build target is controlled by `EDITION` environment variable:

- `self-hosted` (default): Standard Vite build for self-hosted deployments
- `cloud`: Uses `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` for Cloudflare Workers
