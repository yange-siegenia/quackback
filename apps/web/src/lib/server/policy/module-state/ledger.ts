/**
 * The module-scope mutable state ledger (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §4.4).
 *
 * Every site `scan.ts` reports must appear here with a category and a reason.
 * A site the scanner finds and this file does not name **fails CI**, and so
 * does an entry naming a site that no longer exists. That is the whole control:
 * adding a singleton to server code becomes a deliberate edit to a reviewed
 * file, and removing one is not allowed to leave a stale justification behind.
 *
 * ## Categories, and which ones the scanner checks rather than believes
 *
 * The cheap way to defeat a ledger is to write the reassuring word next to the
 * dangerous code. Three of the six categories are therefore verified against
 * the source, so the label cannot be wrong on its own:
 *
 * | category | meaning | verified? |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `workspace-keyed` | partitioned by the active workspace | **yes** — the initializer must be `new WorkspaceKeyedCache` (`factory` sites excepted; see below) |
 * | `workspace-scoped-key` | keyed by something that already identifies one workspace | **yes** — `keyedBy` must name a token that appears in the declaring file |
 * | `refuses-pooled` | only correct single-workspace, and the code refuses to run pooled | **yes** — the declaring file must reference `isPooledTenancy` |
 * | `content-addressed` | the value is a function of the key, so a cross-workspace hit is byte-identical to a recompute | no |
 * | `fleet-wide` | holds only values that are the same for every workspace | no |
 * | `process-lifetime` | a genuine per-process singleton: a latch, a timer, a connection handle | no |
 *
 * `factory` sites are exempt from the `WorkspaceKeyedCache` check because the
 * cache is inside the factory, not at the declaration — `makeStash()` and
 * `createStreamLimiter()` are the two, and both are read by dedicated tests.
 *
 * The three unverified categories are claims a human made, which is why each
 * carries a reason stating the failure that WOULD occur if it were shared. A
 * reason that only says "safe" tells a later reader nothing they can check.
 *
 * ## Adding an entry
 *
 * If the honest category is `process-lifetime`, `fleet-wide` or
 * `content-addressed`, say what a cross-workspace hit would return and why that is
 * the same thing the requesting workspace would have computed. If you cannot write
 * that sentence, the answer is a `WorkspaceKeyedCache`.
