/**
 * S3-Compatible Storage Client
 *
 * Provides a unified interface for uploading files to S3-compatible storage services:
 * - AWS S3
 * - Cloudflare R2
 * - Backblaze B2
 * - MinIO (for local development)
 *
 * Note: AWS SDK imports are dynamic to avoid build issues when packages aren't installed.
 *
 * Type safety: TypeScript with moduleResolution "bundler" cannot fully resolve
 * the AWS SDK v3 barrel exports (deep re-export chains through commands/ and
 * @smithy/smithy-client are only partially resolved). We define structural
 * interfaces for the exact SDK surface we use, with `as unknown as S3Module`
 * applied at the two dynamic import boundaries. All downstream code is fully
 * typed with no `any`.
 *
 * ## Every object name is composed for one workspace
 *
 * Nothing below addresses the bucket directly. {@link currentWorkspaceStorage}
 * returns the only thing that can issue a command; its methods take the *stored*
 * key and compose `w/<selfReportedWorkspaceId>/` internally. It is the only export that
 * yields a client, and the factory behind it is deliberately private — see
 * `workspace-scope.ts` for the hole that was, and `namespace.ts` for why the
 * identifier is `settings.id` and not something else.
 *
 * The exported helpers (`uploadObject`, `getS3Object`, `deleteObject`, the two
 * presigners) keep the signatures ~20 call sites already use and resolve the
 * workspace themselves. Threading a workspace id through those call sites is the
 * convention this design exists to replace: a convention survives until the next
 * call site is added by someone who has not read this file.
 *
 * ## Relocating objects that predate the namespace
 *
 * An install that has been serving before this change holds its objects at bare
 * keys, and composing a namespace makes them unreachable. There is deliberately
 * **no read-time fallback to the bare key.** Under one fleet bucket a bare key
 * is nobody's namespace, so reading it is the §3 failure exactly; and any
 * "…except when the bucket is not shared" carve-out would have to be gated on a
 * configuration value, which is the class of thing nobody checks and everybody
 * eventually gets wrong. The fallback is not merely unsafe by default, it is
 * unsafe in a way nothing in this process can detect.
 *
 * The relocation is instead a one-time move inside the bucket, run by the
 * operator with the credentials they already hold, before the new build serves
 * traffic:
 *
 * ```
 * aws s3 mv s3://<bucket>/ s3://<bucket>/w/<workspace TypeID>/ --recursive --exclude 'w/*'
 * ```
 *
 * The prefix is `fromUuid('workspace', settings.id)` (for example
 * `workspace_01kxddf1jaf6cr22gerxt7z9gg`). `SELECT id FROM settings` returns
 * the UUID spelling; copying under that UUID leaves every restored object
 * unreadable. Convert the UUID before composing `w/<prefix>/`.
 *
 * It is a server-side copy: no bytes leave the bucket, the stored keys do not
 * change, and no content is rewritten, because the namespace appears in neither
 * the database nor any URL. Every affected install holds exactly one workspace
 * per bucket, so that TypeID is unambiguous.
 *
 * **Note what this repository must NOT grow to make that convenient.** Listing
 * and deleting at the bucket root is correct against a bucket that holds one
 * workspace and catastrophic against one that holds the fleet, so the app has no
 * such capability and gains none here, not even for its own migration. The cost
 * is that an operator who deploys without moving the objects serves 404s for
 * pre-existing assets until they do — visible, reversible, and self-announcing,
 * which is the opposite of what the fallback would have been.

 * scope, so an unscoped caller in a pooled process could name any workspace and
 * reach the fleet bucket with the fleet credential. The refusal that makes an
 * unscoped access safe lives in {@link currentWorkspaceId}, and this function
 * did not call it.
 *
 * A guard cannot repair that, because "no scope" is a legitimate state: it is
 * every self-hosted install, and that path resolves correctly by reading its own
 * `settings.id`. So the fix is to remove the choice rather than to police it —
 * {@link currentWorkspaceStorage} is the only door, and it always resolves.
 *
 * Nor could the type system have carried it. `TypeId<'workspace'>` is
 * `` `workspace_${string}` ``, a template-literal type and not a nominal brand,
 * so `` workspaceStorage(`workspace_${req.params.ws}`) `` compiles with no cast
 * and no error. The branded parameter is a real constraint on a *literal*
 * mistake and no constraint at all on an interpolated one.
 *
 * Placement and credentials are read **once, here**, from the scope that is

 * client held across a scope boundary composed its own workspace's prefix
